## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **spyai-labs**, my personal GitHub organization where I build, explore, and share projects across **data engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence**. These repositories demonstrate my skills in:

- Designing **end-to-end ML and AI systems**  
- Building robust **ETL pipelines** and scalable data architectures  
- Automating deployments & infrastructure (**MLOps best practices**)  
- Experiment tracking, model serving & monitoring  
- Exploring **Deep Learning** and **Generative AI (LLMs, transformers, LangChain, etc.)**
